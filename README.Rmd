  fig.path = "plots/desktop/",

  )
```

## Setup/Installation

Most of this repo relies on a personal package I created and nflfastR('https://github.com/mrcaseb/nflfastR') but some simple setup and most of the scripts with automatically render visualizations from NFL data.

Below is some sample code to most of the scripts running out of the gate:

```{r packages, echo = FALSE}
# Dev releases or packages not available on CRAN
# devtools::install_github("mrcaseb/nflfastR")
# devtools::install_github("dynastyprocess/ffscrapr")
# devtools::install_github("jthomasmock/espnscrapeR")
devtools::install_github("colinifer/initR", auth_token = Sys.getenv('authtoken'))
source('init.R')
```

## Create standard session objects/variables
Load the custom/person GG theme for plots

```{r, echo=FALSE}
source('plots/assets/plot_theme.R')
```

## Plots

Team wins over/under expected. The farther a team is beyond the mean, the more they have outperformed expectations according to the nflfastR win probability model.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap='', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Colinifer/football/master/plots/desktop/team_wins/wins_above_expected_scatter_2022.png')
```

QB EPA as a function of team pass blocking.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap='', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Colinifer/football/master/plots/desktop/team_wins/wins_above_expected_scatter_2022.png')
```
